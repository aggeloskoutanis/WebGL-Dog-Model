# WebGL-Dog-Model

## Summary
This project was assigned to us as an assignment for the class "Computer Graphics", which we took during the 8th Semester of our studies in the University of West Attica in Athens, Greece.

The main task of the assignment was to create a dog avatar in 3D space and also give it the ability to move and perform animated moves.

## Prerequisites

The whole project was built using WebGL which is a JavaScript API that can be used in order to render 3D and 2D graphics.

For the development of the project we have used two libraries:

* **gl-matrix-min.js** (Library for handling matrices)
* **webgl-debug.js** (Library for debugging purposes)

Support for WebGL is present in Firefox 4+, Google Chrome 9+, Opera 12+, Safari 5.1+, Internet Explorer 11+, and Microsoft Edge build 10240+.
However, the user's device must also have hardware that supports these features.

## Running

In order for the textures to load properly, you need to set in Firefox security.fileuri.strict_origin_policy to false. Whereas, on Microsoft Edge runs without any changes.

## Usage

Version 4: Select the desired movement that you want to execute and then use the mouse wheel to perform the movement.
Alternitavely, select the animation that you want to perform and press the Start button in order to execute it.
